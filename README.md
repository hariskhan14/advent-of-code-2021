Solving Advent of Code 2021 problems with Test Driven Development laws.

## Test-Driven-Development (TDD)

TDD states to write tests beforehand and drive the production code from the tests. The three simple rules as Martin Fowler defines [here](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html) are:     

* Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
* Write the functional code until the test passes.
* Refactor both new and old code to make it well-structured.
